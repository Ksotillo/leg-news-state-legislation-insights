## System Design

### News Aggregation Strategy
- Articles are fetched from multiple sources using the NewsAPI
- Articles are categorized using keyword-based topic inference
- State information is extracted through keyword matching
- Basic filtering and search functionality implemented through Supabase queries

Note: Future improvements could include:
- Content deduplication through title and content hashing
- Advanced NLP-based categorization
- More sophisticated state and location entity extraction

Proposed Improvements for Multi-Source Aggregation:
1. **Source Integration**:
   - Implement adapters for multiple news APIs (NewsAPI, Reuters, AP)
   - Create standardized format for article data across sources
   - Use webhooks for real-time updates where available

2. **Deduplication Strategy**:
   - Generate content fingerprints using title + first paragraph
   - Implement Levenshtein distance for similarity checking
   - Store article hashes in a separate table for quick comparison
   - Use timestamp + source as additional uniqueness validators

3. **Data Freshness**:
   - Implement TTL (Time-To-Live) for cached articles
   - Set up periodic revalidation (every 15 minutes)
   - Use background jobs for data refresh
   - Maintain update logs for data staleness monitoring

### Data Storage Architecture
- **Primary Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for structured data
- **Caching Layer**: Built-in Next.js caching for API routes
- **Image Storage**: Supabase Storage for article images

Proposed Scalability Solutions:
1. **Database Optimization**:
   - Implement table partitioning by date
   - Create materialized views for common queries
   - Set up read replicas for query distribution
   - Archive older articles to cold storage

2. **Indexing Strategy**:
   - B-tree indexes on frequently queried columns (state, category, date)
   - Full-text search indexes on title and content
   - Composite indexes for common filter combinations
   - Partial indexes for active/recent articles

3. **Data Distribution**:
   - Implement sharding based on date ranges
   - Use content delivery networks for static content
   - Set up geographic data distribution
   - Implement caching at multiple levels

### Caching Implementation
- Server-side caching using Next.js 14 cache()
- Static page generation for common filters
- Revalidation triggers on new article creation
- Client-side caching with SWR for real-time updates

### Search Implementation
- Basic search functionality through Supabase queries
- Paginated results with infinite scroll
- Debounced search input for performance

Proposed Search Improvements:
1. **Search Infrastructure**:
   - Implement Elasticsearch (or similar) for efficient full-text search
   - Set up search indices with proper analyzers
   - Use denormalized search documents
   - Implement faceted search capabilities

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Implement query result caching
   - Use cursor-based pagination
   - Add search result scoring
   - Implement search suggestions

3. **Performance Enhancements**:
   - Asynchronous index updates
   - Search query optimization
   - Result caching strategies
   - Load balancing for search queries

## Scalability Considerations

### Database Structure
- Basic Supabase tables for articles and user preferences
- Simple queries for filtering by state and category
- Standard PostgreSQL indexing

### Performance Optimizations
- Image optimization using Next.js Image component
- Lazy loading for off-screen content

### Load Handling
- Serverless functions for API routes
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

### Future Scale Considerations
- Potential migration to elastic search for better search capabilities
- Implementation of Redis for caching
- Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets
- Microservices architecture for specific features

## Assumptions and Technical Decisions

### Current Limitations
- News API rate limits on free tier
- Limited historical data storage
- Basic text-based search implementation
- Simple category inference

### Technical Decisions
1. **Next.js 14**: Chosen for:
   - Server components
   - Built-in TypeScript support
   - API routes
   - Basic caching

2. **Supabase**: Selected for:
   - Database storage
   - Image storage
   - Basic querying

3. **Clerk**: Implemented for:
   - Secure authentication
   - OAuth integration
   - User management
   - Session handling

### Future Improvements
1. **Features**:
   - Email notifications for saved searches
   - Advanced filtering options
   - Collaborative features
   - Mobile application

2. **Technical**:
   - Advanced analytics
   - Machine learning for better categorization
   - Real-time notifications
   - API rate limit increase

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Multi-region deployment
   - Backup and disaster recovery
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - Performance analytics

### Development Workflow
- Main branch for production code
- Basic ESLint configuration
- TypeScript for type safety

  category TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  urlToImage TEXT,
  author UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW())
);

-- Create user preferences table
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  favorite_states TEXT[],
  favorite_categories TEXT[],
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW())
